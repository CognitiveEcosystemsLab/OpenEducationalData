(Not \"I will offer of advice\", just \"I will offer advice\". Without the \"bits\", there's nothing for the advice to be \"of\".) By saying \"a few bits of advice\", the speaker indicates that he does not have a lot of advice, just a few small pieces. This is a common phrase; it might be considered an idiom. The idea is, I can't give you a complete explanation, but here are a few things that I know.\nAs Robusto says, it has nothing to do with bits in programming. The word \"bit\" here simply means \"a small piece or amount\". Like you can say, \"I ate a little bit of cake\" or \"He cut off a bit of the paper.\"",
